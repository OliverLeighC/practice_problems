## Practice Problems

Various algorithm/tech challenges for my own practice. Written in typescript and tested in jest. Nothing too exciting, mostly sourced from sites like inverview cake, hackernoon, codewars etc

# Want to run the tests?

1. clone the repo
2. run `yarn` in the root dir
3. run `yarn test` to run all test files
