## Practice Problems

Various algorithm/tech challenges for my own practice. Mostly to prevent me from getting complacent or forgetting some of the fundamentals with the rise of gitHub copilot.

Written in typescript and tested in jest. Nothing too exciting, mostly sourced from sites like inverview cake, hackernoon, codewars etc

# Want to run the tests?

1. clone the repo
2. run `yarn` in the root dir
3. run `yarn test` to run all test files
